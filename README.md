# LOZ3
Image Files  
In this lesson you will be modifying both the game.py file and the pygame_functions.py file.  Use your files from last time or download those from LOZ2.  Follow along in the video.  If you get stuck the completed files are here as game1.2.py and pygame_functions2.py.

Extension Ideas -
You will have to make several image files for the different enemies that you want in the game.  Use GIMP or your favorite image editing software to crop out each enemy from enemies.png that you want so that you can animate them in 32 x 32 px tiles.  Name them using LOZ enemy names so that others can use your image files for their games as well.
